# WorkoutApp
I want to build a workout app for myself that i can log access through my local web server. I will need a front end and back end. My ideal language is javascript but I'd we can use whatever is easiest. I only have 2 adjustable dumbells with 5lb increments and an adjustable bench. This is my workout doing about 3-4 sets each exercise and current weights for each arm: Workout 1 - Flat bench at 80lbs, incline bench 65lb each arm, shoulder press 60lb, tricep extensions 25lb, lateral raises 20lb, front raises 15lb. Workout 2 - Dumbbell bent over row 80lb, kelso shurg 80lb, bicep curl 25lb, rear delt fly 15lb, forearm curl 15lb. Workout 3 - Bulgarian split squats 50lb, RDL 80lb, calf raise 80lb, leg raise. It should it should progress between 12-15 reps and once it hit 17 reps, it should increase to the next weight.
